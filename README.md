# nerohiros-xhair
 a simple javascript crosshair that can be used instead of the default GTA5 crosshair

 Hey! I coded this crosshair to be used as a test for my server and decided to throw it on as my first official  Public Development release for FiveM. It doesn't use drawtxt and is done in JSS/CSS/HTML for better resource usage. 

I'm not a big fan of the default GTA crosshair which is why I made this.

This is a standalone release and I might update it in the future for a dynamic effect when shooting.

Once you get it loaded up simply pull out a weapon and free aim and hit x to toggle the crosshair. and x to shut it off, the crosshair will fade in and out when you are aiming and not aiming and it doesn't work in first person.

any issues feel free to contact me on the fivem forums -NeroHiro or on discord NeroHiro#0001
